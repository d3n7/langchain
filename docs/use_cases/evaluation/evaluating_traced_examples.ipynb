    "## Running Chains on Traced Datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "Developing applications with language models can be uniquely challenging. To manage this complexity and ensure reliable performance, LangChain provides tracing and evaluation functionality through . This notebook demonstrates how to run Chains, which are language model functions, on previously captured datasets or traces. Some common use cases for this approach include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Running an evaluation chain to grade previous runs.\n",
    "- Comparing different chains, LLMs, and agents on traced datasets.\n",
    "- Executing a stochastic chain multiple times over a dataset to generate metrics before deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that this notebook assumes you have LangChain+ tracing running in the background. To set it up, follow the [tracing directions here](..\\/..\\/tracing\\/local_installation.md).\n"
